Interactive Navigation Menu
Welcome to the Interactive Navigation Menu project! This project is your solution for creating a dynamic and visually engaging navigation menu that enhances user experience. Developed as a part of my tasks at Prodigy Infotech, this interactive menu showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve a highly responsive and interactive user interface element.
